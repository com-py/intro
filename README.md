## Programs are arranged by chapter, then by notebook format (`.ipynb`) and standard format (`.py`) in `Python` subfolders. A `-vp` in a program name indicates a `vpython` animation program.
- ### To run a program online in Binder: Choose a chap above, then click on a notebook link near the bottom (*Note: server image building/loading may be slow the first time*). 
- ### You can download everything in a zip file by selecting `code` above (clone). 
- ### To download a single program, navigate to the right subfolder, click on it, choose `raw`, then save (right click) it as  `.ipynb` or `.py` file.
- ### Select `GlowScript` programs are at [https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/jaywang/folder/intro/](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/jaywang/folder/intro/)
