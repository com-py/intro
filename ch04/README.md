## `Python` subfolder contains standard `.py` programs. You can download everything in a zip file by going up to the [`root folder`](https://github.com/com-py/intro) and select `code` (clone). To download a single program here, click on it, choose `raw`, then save (right click) it as  `.ipynb` file.
